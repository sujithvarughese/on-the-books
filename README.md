ON THE BOOKS - 

This app allows the user to search for books based on genre, and will use the OpenLibrary Subject API to return results based on user search. User can view the search results and will be provided links to preview the book, and to get more information/reviews. The user can choose to add the book to myLibrary.

In myLibrary, the user will have basic book information along with the ability to create and edit notes. The user can organize the notes in any way (chapter, topic, subject, etc).
